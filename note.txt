Firstly, we trained Decision Tree with default parameters. 

Even though its predictions were optimistic for the testing dataset, 
It can be seen that the loss on the test was high.
it was clearly overfitting.

The model was complex due to it trying to fit all the training
 dataset and couldn’t generalize well for new datas.
 
It can be seen that the loss on the test was high.

so for out thyroid dataset we perfomred SMOTE oversampling technique.
*******synthetic minority oversampling technique

another decision tree model was trained on balanced dataset.
 This model was not complex thus could generalize to new unseen datas.
 
 Other models for classifications were tested as svm mlp and rf.
 
 however the performance for svm was subpar compared to other models where as other
 models worked well on the dataset.
 
We had to make sure the models was correctly classifying positive instancecs.


Recall is the primary focus of criteria for our models(Low False-Negatives). 
Generally, recall improves at the expense of precision or precision improves at the expense of recall

While, balancing the dataset,
recall was improved while trading-off precision, we had to make sure the trade-off in
precision is not that large(High False-Positives).

employed soft max voting ensembled model to generate best possible model.
This ensembled model has high recall score while balancing out the precision tradeoff.

After finalizing the ensemble model as our model to classify thyroids for early diagnosis,
 we exported this model as a pickle file.
 pickle file is made to
predict the classifications of new datas entered by the final system’s user.

We prepared a simple and interactive web-app through the use of streamlit for users to interact with
the system.
